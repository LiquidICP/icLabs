								<p>IC CARDS is an NFT-based role-playing game on the Internet Computer blockchain where you use your NFTs to craft tools & equipment, train your skills and ultimately fight your way through dungeons and find treasure.
								</p>
								<h3>Materials</h3>
								<p>
									To be able to equip yourself you need to craft a good piece of armour and a sturdy weapon. For this you need materials. These materials need to be crafted and for that you need raw materials like wood, stone and metal which can be found in packs. At a later point there will be ways to use your NFTs to gather your own raw materials. There are two main types of materials: wood & ores. You can find these in different rarities. With these materials you can craft processed materials like planks, ingots and gems. If you are really lucky you can even find a pearl which are the rarest thing in the game.
								</p>
								<h3>Crafting</h3>	
								<p>
									Crafting is an important part of IC CARDS. It is possible to find a sword in a dungeon but the best equipment you make yourself! With raw materials you create processed materials and with those processed materials you can eventually craft weapons and armour. To get the most out of your materials you can even craft tools and toolstations.
								</p>
								<h3>Packs</h3>
								<p>
									In IC CARDS you can get 4 kinds of packs which have a fixed price in dollars that changes with the ICP price. The higher the rarity of the pack, the higher the chance of getting rare materials or even one of the legendary pearls for the best crafts currently available. A pack contains 5 NFTs. You can open them at any time. It is even possible to open one card and save the rest for a luckier day.

								<p>Frog Wars is a turn based strategy game which will be played on 24x12 square tiled map. 2 players will compete against each other where initially each player will have to own an nft character and will need to own a specific amount of ICP coins to enter the game. 
								</p>
								<p>Players will have to control their units and use various strategies to win the battle and the prize-90% of total ICP that was collected from both players before the start of the game, 10% of total collected ICP goes to the further development of the game. 
									The loser will get a specific amount of Crone token which he/she can utilize to upgrade his/her game character stats. 
									Crone token is minted only when someone loses the game so initial amount of Crone token is 0.</p>
								<p>	Nft holders from any set of 2d, voxel, or 3d, will be eligible for the drop which is necessary to be able to play the game, or else one will have to purchase base nft characters from the market.

								<p>Game wiki coming soon!!!</p>
